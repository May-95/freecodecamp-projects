            Alan Rickman was a talented English actor and director, born on
            February 21, 1946, in London, England. He attended the Royal Academy
            of Dramatic Art and began his career in theatre before moving on to
            film and television. Rickman became widely known for his role as
            Hans Gruber in the action film Die Hard (1988), which brought him
            international recognition. He also starred in many other successful
            films, including Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), Sense and
            Sensibility (1995), and the Harry Potter series (2001-2011), where
            he played the character of Severus Snape, which became one of his
            most iconic roles. Throughout his career, Rickman was widely
            respected for his talent and dedication to his craft. He won
            numerous awards for his work, including a Golden Globe, an Emmy, and
            a BAFTA. In addition to his acting, Rickman was also an accomplished
            director and producer, and served as the artistic director of the
            Royal Court Theatre for a time. He was known for his deep and
            distinctive voice. He was a versatile actor who was equally at home
            in drama and comedy, and he was admired by his colleagues for his
            talent, professionalism, and kindness. His death on January 14,
            2016, at the age of 69, was a great loss to the acting world, and he
            is remembered fondly by his fans and fellow actors alike.
