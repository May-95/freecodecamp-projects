          <span class="bold">M</span>arkup <span class="bold">L</span>anguage)
          is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
          example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a
          list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title
          suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and
          its functions.

        <header class="h2-heading">So what is HTML?</header>
        <p class="paragraph">
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
          hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
          bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
          content:
        </p>
        <code class="code-snippet">My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p class="paragraph">
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>
        <code class="code-snippet">&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/p&gt;</code>
      </section>
      <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section">
        <header class="h3-heading">Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p class="paragraph">The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The opening tag:</span> This consists of the name
            of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
            <span class="bold">angle brackets</span>. This states where the
            element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the
            paragraph begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The closing tag:</span> This is the same as the
            opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
            element name. This states where the element ends — in this case
            where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the
            standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The content:</span> This is the content of the
            element, which in this case, is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The element:</span> The opening tag, the closing
            tag, and the content together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
        </p>
        <img
          class="attribute-img"
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't
          want to appear in the actual content. Here,
          <span class="grey">class</span> is the attribute name and
          <span class="grey">editor-note</span> is the attribute value. The
          <span class="grey">class</span> attribute allows you to give the
          element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any
          other elements with the same <span class="grey">class</span> value)
          with style information and other things. Some attributes have no
          value, such as <span class="grey">required</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
            if the element already has one or more attributes).
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>
            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="Nesting_elements" class="main-section">
        <header class="h3-heading">Nesting elements</header>
        <p class="paragraph">
          You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
          <span class="bold">nesting</span>. If we wanted to state that our cat
          is <span class="bold">very</span> grumpy, we could wrap the word
          "very" in a <span class="grey">&ltstrong&gt</span> element, which
          means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
        <code class="code-snippet">
          &lt<span class="green">p</span>>My cat is &lt<span class="green"

          >>very&lt/<span class="green">strong</span>> grumpy.&lt/<span
            class="green"
            >p</span
          >>

      </section>
      <section id="Void_elements" class="main-section">
        <header class="h3-heading">Void elements</header>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the
          <img /> element that we already have in our HTML page:
        </p>
        <code class="code-snippet">
          &lt<span class="green">img</span> <span class="red">src</span>="<span

        </code>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
          <span class="grey">&lt/img></span> tag and no inner content. This is
          because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its
          purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.

          That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't
          handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are

          <li>
            <span class="grey">&lt!DOCTYPE html></span> — doctype. It is a
            required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around
            1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that
            the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could
            mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However,
            these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make
            sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know
            for now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="grey">&lthtml>&lt/html></span> — the
            <span class="grey">&lthtml></span> element. This element wraps all
            the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root
            element. It also includes the
            <span class="grey">lang</span> attribute, setting the primary
            language of the document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="grey">&lthead>&lt/head></span> — the
            <span class="grey">&lthead></span> element. This element acts as a
            container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page
            that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This
            includes things like keywords and a page description that you want
            to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set
            declarations, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="grey">&ltmeta charset="utf-8"></span> — This element
            sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which
            includes most characters from the vast majority of written
            languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you
            might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help
            avoid some problems later on.

              >&ltmeta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"></span
            >
            — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of
            viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than
            the viewport and then shrinking them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="grey">&lttitle>&lt/title></span> — the
            <span class="grey">&lttitle></span> element. This sets the title of
            your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the
            page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
            bookmark/favorite it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="grey">&ltbody>&lt/body></span> — the
            <span class="grey">&ltbody></span> element. This contains all the
            content that you want to show to web users when they visit your
            page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio
            tracks, or whatever else

          We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt
          attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the
          image, possibly because of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual
            impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the
            alt text to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For
            example, try deliberately changing the path inside your
            <span class="grey">src</span> attribute to make it incorrect. If you
            save and reload the page, you should see something like this in
            place of the image:
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you
          write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good
          idea of what the image conveys.
